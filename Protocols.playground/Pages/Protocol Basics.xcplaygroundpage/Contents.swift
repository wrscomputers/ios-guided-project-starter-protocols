//: # Protocols
//: Protocols are, as per Apple's definition in the _Swift Programming Language_ book:
//:
//: "... a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol."
//:
//: The below example shows a protocol that requires conforming types have a particular property defined.



//: Protocols can also require that conforming types implement certain methods.
